# MLDA_Coursera_Week_4
For week 4 assignment, I am running a k-Means cluster analysis model that works on a data set used to predict the relationship between the weight of a given cat and other physical characteristics. In this data set we have five clustering variables: three quantitative (body_length, tail_length, height) and two qualitative (tail_texture and coat_colour). Tail_texture takes on values 0 and 1 which represent "smooth" and "bushy" respectively. Coat_colour takes on two values 0 and 1 which represent "yellow" and "grey" respectively. We are using a k-Means clustering model to find which clusters of data values match with some important average values in weight of the cat.
